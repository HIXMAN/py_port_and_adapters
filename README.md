# Ports and Adapters Pattern

## Overview
This repository serves as an experimental playground for understanding and implementing the Port and Adapter architectural pattern. It is not intended for production use but rather for educational purposes.

## Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to provide a practical demonstration and explanation of the Port and Adapter pattern. By exploring this pattern within this repository, developers can gain a deeper understanding of its concepts and how it can be applied in real-world scenarios.

## What is Port and Adapter?
The Port and Adapter pattern, also known as the Hexagonal Architecture or Ports and Adapters Architecture, is a design pattern used to create loosely coupled application components. It focuses on separating the core business logic (ports) from external dependencies such as databases, user interfaces, or third-party services (adapters). This separation allows for greater flexibility, testability, and maintainability of the application.
